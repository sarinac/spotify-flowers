# spotify-flowers ðŸŒ¸ ðŸŒ¹ ðŸŒº

This project is version 2 of my [design on visualizing Spotify data with d3.js](https://github.com/sarinac/Visual-Sandbox/tree/master/03_electroswing_on_spotify). I created a visual for 1 song (Lone Digger by Caravan Palace) and then wanted to extend it for any song found on Spotify. 

## Instructions

```

### Set up Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment.
